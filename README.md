check out the original spindafy thing here! https://github.com/Ovidios/spindafy/tree/main

I watched this video and thought it was cool, so hey, why not try it myself?

Decided to try a different approach, where i find the average darkest pixel in each area to determine where the spinda dots should go instead of a genetic algorithm. Its very stupid and simple and not very optimised, and includes a try catch that stops it from doing an error that i have no idea why happens, but uhh, here we go.

Simply input the file path of the image you want to spindafy, and itll get drawn to the 'images' folder in the folder its running in

This was only designed to work on windows, so there is a 99% chance it will just crash if you try and use any other OS.
